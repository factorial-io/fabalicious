The basic setup is that your host-configuration has a \ndocker\n-section, which contains a \nconfiguration\n-key. The \ndockerHosts\n-section of your fabfile.yaml has a list of tasks which are executed on the \"parent-host\" of the configuration. Please have a look at the docker-section for more information.\n\n\nMost of the time the docker-container do not have a public or known ip-address. Fabalicious tries to find out the ip-address of a given instance and use that for communicating with its services.\n\n\nThere are three implicit tasks available:\n\n\ncopySSHKeys\n\n\nfab config:mbb docker:copySSHKeys\n\n\n\n\nThis will copy the ssh-keys into the docker-instance. You'll need to provide the paths to the files via the three configurations:\n\n \ndockerKeyFile\n, the path to the private ssh-key to use.\n\n \ndockerAuthorizedKeyFile\n, the path to the file for \nauthoried_keys\n\n* \ndockerKnownHostsFile\n, the path to the file for \nknown_hosts\n\n\nAs docker-container do not have any state, this task is used to copy any necessary ssh-configuration into the docker-container, so communication per ssh does not need any passwords.\n\n\nstartRemoteAccess\n\n\nfab config:\nconfig\n docker:startRemoteAccess\nfab config:\nconfig\n docker:startRemoteAccess,port=\nport\n,publicPort=\npublic-port\n\n\n\n\n\nThis docker-task will run a ssh-command to forward a local port to a port inside the docker-container. It starts a new ssh-session which will do the forwarding. When finished, type \nexit\n.\n\n\nExamples\n\n\n\n\nfab config:mbb docker:startRemoteAccess\n will forward \nlocalhost:8888\n to port \n80\n of the docker-container\n\n\nfab config:mbb docker:startRemoteAccess,port=3306,publicPort=33060\n will forward \nlocalhost:33060\nto port \n3306\n of the docker-container\n\n\n\n\nwaitForServices\n\n\nThis task will try to establish a ssh-connection into the docker-container and if the connection succeeds, waits for \nsupervisorctl status\n to return success. This is useful in scripts to wait for any services that need some time to start up. Obviously this task depends on \nsupervisorctl\n.\n\n\nlogLevel\n\n\nCan be used to override default logging level used by fabalicious.\nAvailable values :\n\n\n\n\nDEBUG\n\n\nINFO\n\n\nWARNING\n\n\nERROR\n\n\nCRITICAL\n\n\n\n\nExamples\n\n\n\n\nfab logLevel:DEBUG config:mbb ssh\n will start outputting DEBUG level messages.",

Please make sure SSH key forwarding is enabled on your installation. \npassword\n should only used as an exception.\n\n\ntype\n defines the type of installation. Currently there are four types available:\n\n\ndev\n for dev-installations, they won't backup the databases on deployment\n\n\ntest\n for test-installations, similar than \ndev\n, no backups on deployments\n\n\nstage\n for staging-installations.\n\n\nlive\n for live-installations.

Defaults to \nrootFolder\n\n\ncomposerRootFolder\n the folder where the composer.json for the project is stored, defaults to \ngitRootFolder\n.\n\n\nbackupFolder\n the folder, where fabalicious should store its backups into\n\n\nrunLocally\n if set to true, all commands are run on the local host, not on a remote host. Good for local development on linux or tools like MAMP.\n\n\nsiteFolder\n is a drupal-specific folder, where the settings.php resides for the given installation. This allows to interact with multisites etc.\n\n\nfilesFolder\n the path to the files-folder, where user-assets get stored and which should be backed up by the \nfiles\n-method\n\n\ntmpFolder\n name of tmp-folder, defaults to \n/tmp\n\n\nsupportsBackups\n defaults to true, set to false, if backups are not supported\n\n\nsupportsZippedBackups\n defaults to true.

This is handy for dockerized installations, where the ssh-port of the docker-instance is not public. \nsshTunnel\n needs the following informations\n\n\nbridgeHost\n: the host acting as a bridge.\n\n\nbridgeUser\n: the ssh-user on the bridge-host\n\n\nbridgePort\n: the port to connect to on the bridge-host\n\n\nlocalPort\n: the local port which gets forwarded to the \ndestPort\n. If \nlocalPort\n is omitted, the ssh-port of the host-configuration is used. If the host-configuration does not have a port-property a random port is used.\n\n\ndestHost\n: the destination host to forward to\n\n\ndestHostFromDockerContainer\n: if set, the docker's Ip address is used for destHost. This is automatically set when using a \ndocker\n-configuration, see there.\n\n\ndestPort\n: the destination port to forward to\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndocker\n for all docker-relevant configuration. \nconfiguration\n and \nname\n are the only required keys, all other are optional and used by the docker-tasks.\n\n\nconfiguration\n should contain the key of the dockerHost-configuration in \ndockerHosts\n\n\nname\n contains the name of the docker-container. This is needed to get the IP-address of the particular docker-container when using ssh-tunnels (see above).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndockerHosts\n\n\ndockerHosts\n is similar structured as the \nhosts\n-entry. It's a keyed lists of hosts containing all necessary information to create a ssh-connection to the host, controlling the docker-instances, and a list of tasks, the user might call via the \ndocker\n-command. See the \ndocker\n-entry for a more birds-eye-view of the concepts.\n\n\nHere's an example \ndockerHosts\n-entry:\n\n\ndockerHosts:\n  mbb:\n    runLocally: false\n    host: multibasebox.dev\n    user: vagrant\n    password: vagrant\n    port: 22\n    rootFolder: /vagrant\n    environment:\n      VHOST: %host.host%\n      WEBROOT: %host.rootFolder%\n    tasks:\n      logs:\n        - docker logs %host.docker.name%\n\n\n\n\nHere's a list of all possible entries of a dockerHosts-entry:\n\n\n\n\nrunLocally\n: if this is set to \ntrue\n, all docker-scripts are run locally, and not on a remote host.\n\n\nhost\n, \nuser\n, \nport\n and \npassword\n: all needed information to start a ssh-connection to that host. These settings are only respected, if \nrunLocally\n is set to \nfalse\n. \nport\n and \npassword\n are optional.\n\n\nenvironment\n a keyed list of environment-variables to set, when running one of the tasks. The replacement-patterns of \nscripts\n are supported, see there for more information.\n\n\ntasks\n a keyed list of commands to run for a given docker-subtask (similar to \nscripts\n). Note: these commands are running on the docker-host, not on the host. All replacement-patterns do work, and you can call even other tasks via \nexecute(\ntask\n, \nsubtask\n)\n e.g. \nexecute(docker, stop)\n See the \nscripts\n-section for more info.\n\n\n\n\nYou can use \ninheritsFrom\n to base your configuration on an existing one. You can add any configuration you may need and reference to that information from within your tasks via the replacement-pattern \n%dockerHost.keyName%\n e.g. \n%dockerHost.host%\n.\n\n\nYou can reference a specific docker-host-configuration from your host-configuration via\n\n\nhosts:\n  test:\n    docker:\n      configuration: mbb\n\n\n\n\ncommon\n\n\ncommon contains a list of commands, keyed by task and type which gets executed when the task is executed.\n\n\nExample:\n\n\ncommon:\n  reset:\n    dev:\n      - echo \nrunning reset on a dev-instance\n\n    stage:\n      - echo \nrunning reset on a stage-instance\n\n    prod:\n      - echo \nrunning reset on a prod-instance\n\n  deployPrepare:\n    dev:\n      - echo \npreparing deploy on a dev instance\n\n  deploy:\n    dev:\n      - echo \ndeploying on a dev instance\n\n  deployFinished:\n    dev:\n      - echo \nfinished deployment on a dev instance\n\n\n\n\n\nThe first key is the task-name (\nreset\n, \ndeploy\n, ...), the second key is the type of the installation (\ndev\n, \nstage\n, \nprod\n, \ntest\n). Every task is prepended by a prepare-stage and appended by a finished-stage, so you can call scripts before and after an actual task. You can even run other scripts via the \nexecute\n-command, see the \nscripts\n-section.\n\n\nscripts\n\n\nA keyed list of available scripts. This scripts may be defined globally (on the root level) or on a per host-level. The key is the name of the script and can be executed via\n\n\nfab config:\nconfiguration\n script:\nkey\n\n\n\n\n\nA script consists of an array of commands which gets executed sequentially.\n\n\nAn example:\n\n\nscripts:\n  test:\n    - echo \nRunning script test\n\n  test2:\n    - echo \nRunning script test2 on %host.config_name%\n    - execute(script, test)\n\n\n\n\nScripts can be defined on a global level, but also on a per host-level.\n\n\nYou can declare default-values for arguments via a slightly modified syntax:\n\n\nscripts:\n  defaultArgumentTest:\n    defaults:\n      name: Bob\n    script:\n      - echo \nHello %arguments.name%\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning the script via \nfab config:mbb script:defaultArgumentTest,name=\"Julia\"\n will show \nHello Julia\n. Running \nfab config:mbb script:defaultArgumentTest\n will show \nHello Bob\n.\n\n\nFor more information see the main scripts section below.\n\n\nother\n\n\n\n\ndeploymentModule\n name of the deployment-module the drush-method enables when doing a deploy\n\n\nusePty\n defaults to true, set it to false when you can't connect to specific hosts.\n\n\nuseShell\n defaults to true, set it to false, when you can't connect to specific hosts.\n\n\ndisableKnownHosts\n defaults to false, set it too true, if you trust every host\n\n\ngitOptions\n a keyed list of options to apply to a git command. Currently only pull is supported. If your git-version does not support \n--rebase\n you can disable it via an empty array: \npull: []\n\n\nsqlSkipTables\n a list of table-names drush should omit when doing a backup.\n\n\nconfigurationManagement\n a list of configuration-labels to import on \nreset\n. This defaults to \n['staging']\n and may be overridden on a per-host basis. You can add command arguments to the the configuration label.\n\n\n\n\nExample:\n\n\ndeploymentModule: my_deployment_module\nusePty: false\nuseShell: false\ngitOptions:\n  pull:\n    - --rebase\n    - --quiet\nsqlSkipTables:\n  - cache\n  - watchdog\n  - session\nconfigurationManagement:\n   - staging\n   - dev -- partial\n\n\n\n\nInheritance\n\n\nSometimes it make sense to extend an existing configuration or to include configuration from other places from the file-system or from remote locations. There's a special key \ninheritsFrom\n which will include the yaml found at the location and merge it with the data. This is supported for entries in \nhosts\n and \ndockerHosts\n and for the fabfile itself.\n\n\nIf a \nhost\n, a \ndockerHost\n or the fabfile itself has the key \ninheritsFrom\n, then the given key is used as a base-configuration. Here's a simple example:\n\n\nhosts:\n  default:\n    port: 22\n    host: localhost\n    user: default\n  example1:\n    inheritsFrom: default\n    port: 23\n  example2:\n    inheritsFrom: example1\n    user: example2\n\n\n\n\nexample1\n will store the merged configuration from \ndefault\n with the configuration of \nexample1\n. \nexample2\n is a merge of all three configurations: \nexample2\n with \nexample1\n with \ndefault\n.\n\n\nhosts:\n  example1:\n    port: 23\n    host: localhost\n    user: default\n  example2:\n    port: 23\n    host: localhost\n    user: example2\n\n\n\n\nYou can even reference external files to inherit from:\n\n\nhosts:\n  fileExample:\n    inheritsFrom: ./path/to/config/file.yaml\n  httpExapme:\n    inheritsFrom: http://my.tld/path/to/config_file.yaml\n\n\n\n\nThis mechanism works also for the fabfile.yaml / index.yaml itself, and is not limited to one entry:\n\n\nname: test fabfile\n\ninheritsFrom:\n  - ./mbb.yaml\n  - ./drupal.yaml\n\n\n\n\nScripts\n\n\nScripts are a powerful concept of fabalicious. There are a lot of places where scripts can be called. The \ncommon\n-section defines common scripts to be run for specific task/installation-type-configurations, docker-tasks are also scripts which you can execute via the docker-command. And you can even script fabalicious tasks and create meta-tasks.\n\n\nA script is basically a list of commands which get executed via shell on a remote machine. To stay independent of the host where the script is executed, fabalicious parsed the script before executing it and replaces given variables with their counterpart in the yams file.\n\n\nReplacement-patterns\n\n\nReplacement-Patterns are specific strings enclosed in \n%\ns, e.g. \n%host.port%\n, \n%dockerHost.rootFolder%\n or \n%arguments.name%\n.\n\n\nHere's a simple example;\n\n\nscript:\n  test:\n    - echo \nI am running on %host.config_name%\n\n\n\n\n\nCalling this script via\n\n\nfab config:mbb script:test\n\n\n\n\nwill show \nI am running on mbb\n.\n\n\n\n\nThe host-configuration gets exposes via the \nhost.\n-prefix, so \nport\n maps to \n%host.port%\n, etc.\n\n\nThe dockerHost-configuration gets exposed via the \ndockerHost\n-prefix, so \nrootFolder\n maps to \n%dockerHost.rootFolder%\n\n\nThe global configuration of the yams-file gets exposed to the \nsettings\n-prefix, so \nuuid\n gets mapped to `%settings.uuid%\n\n\nOptional arguments to the \nscript\n-taks get the \nargument\n-prefix, e.g. \n%arguments.name%\n. You can get all arguments via \n%arguments.combined%\n.\n\n\nYou can access hierarchical information via the dot-operator, e.g. \n%host.database.name%\n\n\n\n\nIf fabalicious detects a pattern it can't replace it will abort the execution of the script and displays a list of available replacement-patterns.\n\n\nInternal commands\n\n\nThere are currently 3 internal commands. These commands control the flow inside fabalicious:\n\n\n\n\nfail_on_error(1|0)\n If fail_on_error is set to one, fabalicious will exit if one of the script commands returns a non-zero return-code. When using \nfail_on_error(0)\n only a warning is displayed, the script will continue.\n\n\nexecute(task, subtask, arguments)\n execute a fabalicious task. For example you can run a deployment from a script via \nexecute(deploy)\n or stop a docker-container from a script via \nexecute(docker, stop)\n\n\nfail_on_missing_directory(directory, message)\n will print message \nmessage\n if the directory \ndirectory\n does not exist.\n\n\n\n\nTask-related scripts\n\n\nYou can add scripts to the \ncommon\n-section, which will called for any host. You can differentiate by task-name and host-type, e.g. create a script which gets called for the task \ndeploy\n and type \ndev\n.\n\n\nYou can even run scripts before or after a task is executed. Append the task with \nPrepare\n or \nFinished\n.\n\n\nYou can even run scripts for specific tasks and hosts. Just add your script with the task-name as its key.\n\n\nhost:\n  test:\n    deployPrepare:\n      - echo \nPreparing deploy for test\n\n    deploy:\n      - echo \nDeploying on test\n\n    deployFinished:\n      - echo \nDeployment finished for test\n\n\n\n\n\nThese scripts in the above examples gets executed only for the host \ntest\n and task \ndeploy\n.\n\n\nExamples\n\n\nA rather complex example scripting fabalicious.\n\n\nscripts:\n  runTests:\n    defaults:\n      branch: develop\n    script:\n      - execute(docker, start)\n      - execute(docker, waitForServices)\n      - execute(deploy, %arguments.branch%)\n      - execute(script, behatInstall)\n      - execute(script, behat, --profile=ci --format=junit --format=progress)\n      - execute(getFile, /var/www/_tools/behat/build/behat/default.xml, ./_tools/behat)\n      - execute(docker, stop)\n\n\n\n\nThis script will\n\n\n\n\nstart the docker-container,\n\n\nwait for it,\n\n\ndeploys the given branch,\n\n\nrun a script which will install behat,\n\n\nrun behat with some custom arguments,\n\n\ngets the result-file and copy it to a location,\n\n\nand finally stops the container.",

If the host-configuration does not have a port-property a random port is used.  destHost : the destination host to forward to  destHostFromDockerContainer : if set, the docker's Ip address is used for destHost. This is automatically set when using a  docker -configuration, see there.  destPort : the destination port to forward to    docker  for all docker-relevant configuration.  configuration  and  name  are the only required keys, all other are optional and used by the docker-tasks.  configuration  should contain the key of the dockerHost-configuration in  dockerHosts  name  contains the name of the docker-container. This is needed to get the IP-address of the particular docker-container when using ssh-tunnels (see above).",

With some shell-magic you can streamline it into a single shell-command. This command will not have the downsides of the \nssh\n-command e.g. the lagging shell.\n\n\nnew task \ninstallFrom\n which will do a install-task and a copyFrom afterwards.

Use as the first task\n\n\n$ fab offline config:my_config about\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSupport for \nmodules_enabled.txt\n and \nmodules_disabled.txt\n. Listed modules in these files get enabled or disabled when doing a reset (drush7 and drush8) You can add configuration to ignore some of the modules:\n\n\nmodulesEnabledIgnore:\n  - coffee\n  - some_other_module\nmodulesDisabledIgnore:\n  - devel\n\n\n\nThese settings can be part of the global configuration or of the host configuration.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdd a new optional per-host-setting to set the composer root folder called \ncompserRootFolder\n, if not present the \ngitRootFolder\n gets used\n\n\n\n\nYou can specify now the locale, distribution and other options for the drush install-task. These settings may be global or a per host-setting.\ninstallOptions:\n  distribution: thunder\n  locale: de\n  options: \"thunder_module_configure_form.install_modules_thunder_demo=NULL\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.2.0\n\n\nnew\n\n\n\n\nwhen running \ncomposer install\n fabalicious will create automatically a symlink to \nfabfile.py\n.\n\n\nnew option \nskipCreateDatabase\n in \ndatabase\n, if set to \nTrue\n no database will be created.\n\n\nexecutables can now have variables, they will get expanded beforehand (for an example see next line)\n\n\n\n\nexecutables have a new special variables called \n%arguments%\n which contains the arguments for an executable, here's an example:\n\n\nexecutables:\n  drush: docker exec -itu drupal %host.docker.name% bash -c 'cd %host.docker.siteFolder% \n drush %arguments%'\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsupport for custom executable paths has been added. This will help getting specific hosting-environments to corporate nicely with fabalicious.\n\n\nTo change the standard executable-name and path, add an \nexecutables\n-section to your host or your global settings:\n\n\nexecutables:\n  drush: /opt/bin/local/drush\n  git: /usr/local/bin/git\n\n\n\nIt will also work for your custom scripts, but only if you use the newly introduced \"shebang\"-syntax for executables. Instead of writing \ndrush\n prefix the command with \n#!\n, e.g. \n!#drush\n:\n\n\nscript:\n  example:\n    - cd %host.siteFolder%; #!drush cc all\n    - cd %host.gitRootFolder%; #!npm install\n\n\n\nThis will also work for custom executables (in the example \nnpm\n), but do not forget to add the executable to the \nexecutables\n-section.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.1.0\n\n\nnew\n\n\n\n\n\n\nnew task \ncompletions\n which will help to get completions in the shell working. Currently only for the \nfish\n-shell.\n\n\ncomplete -c fab -e -f\ncomplete -c fab -f -a \"(fab completions:type=fish)\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nnew tasks \ncreateApp\n and \ndestroyApp\n. Needs docker and is not available on local. \ncreateApp\n will clone the repository, start the docker-container and install the app. \ndestroyApp\n will destroy the app and remove any containers.\n\n\n\n\nnew task \nblueprint\n. This task will load a template from the fabfile.yaml, do some pattern replacement and use the resulting data as the current configuration. With this task it is easy to create dynamic configurations e.g. for CI-integration or similar scenarios.\n\n\nrunLocally\n for dockerHosts: if set to true for a given dockerHost-configuration, the commands get executed locally.\n\n\nrunLocally\n for hosts: if set to true for a given host-configuration, all commands are run locally.\n\n\nnew task \ndoctor\n. This will try to do all necessary connections and will inform of any problems. Good for troubleshooting.\n\n\nfabfile.local.yaml will override existing fabfile.yaml-configuration. the file may reside up to three folders above the projects fabfile. See the readme for more info\n\n\nsupport for platform.sh\n\n\n\n\nchanged\n\n\n\n\nfabfile.yaml.lock is not used anymore. To support offline-mode, fabalicious will store all remote files in the \n~/.fabalicious\n folder. If loading a remote resource fails, fabalicious will use the local cached version of that file.\n\n\ndrush8: configurationManagement is completely configurable, e.g. to run a script, add this to your fabfile.yaml\nconfigurationManagement:\n  staging:\n    - execute(script, config-import)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.0.0\n\n\nnew\n\n\n\n\n\n\nyou can now specify what features you need. The following features are available: \ncomposer\n, \ndocker\n, \ndrush7\n, \ndrush8\n, \ngit\n, \nssh\n, \nfiles\n, \nslack\n, \ndrupalconsole\n. You specify your needs in the fabfile with the \nneeds\n-key. You can declare this globally and/or per host.\n\n\nneeds:\n  - git\n  - drush8\n  - composer\n  - slack\n  - ssh\n  - files\n\n\nneeds\n defaults to \ngit\n, \nssh\n, \ndrush7\n and \nfiles\n if not set explicitly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nnew key \nenvironment\n, you can declare a list of environment-variables in \nhosts\n and \ndockerHosts\n which get exposed to the running scripts. You can even use the known replacement-patterns available to scripts\n\n\nenvironment:\n  - ROOT_FOLDER: \"%dockerHost.rootFolder%/%host.docker.projectFolder%\"\n  - TYPE: \"%host.type%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nthe replacement-patterns already available for docker-scripts are now available for all scripts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nevery task may have a script, which gets called, when the task gets executed. There are three stages for every task available: \ntask\nPrepare\n, \ntask\n and \ntask\nFinished\n. Here's an example for the deploy-task:\n\n\ndeployPrepare:\n  - echo \"Preparing deployment \u2026\"\ndeploy:\n  - echo \"Deploying \u2026\"\ndeployFinished:\n  - echo \"Finished with deployment.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can now add custom scripts to your fabfile and run it via the \nscript\n-task. Declare your scripts on the root level. Here's an example:\n\n\nscripts:\n testScript:\n   - echo \"This is a test-script\u2026\"\n\n\nNow you can run the script via\n\n\nfab config:\nconfig\n script:testScript\n\n\nIf you need default arguments, you can split your script-declaration as follows:\n\n\nscripts:\n  hello:\n    defaults:\n      name: world\n    script:\n      - echo \"hello %arguments.name%\"\n\n\nRunning \nfab config:\nconfig\n script:hello\n will print \"hello world\". Running \nfab config:\nconfig\n script:hello,name=\"universum\"\n will print \"hello universum\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\nyou can specify a branch when running the deploy-task: \ndeploy:\nbranchname\n. This will override the branch temporary.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can now specify port and the public port for the startRemoteAccess subtask: To create a tunnel to the mysql-server you can use\n\n\nfab config:\nyour-config\n docker:startRemoteAccess,port=3306,publicPort=33060\n\n* You can run other tasks from  within your scripts, use the reserved keyword \nexecute\n\n\ntestScript:\n  - execute(deploy)\n  - execute(docker, start)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt should be easier to extend fabalicious to support other hosting environments or applications. You can now add custom scripts to your fabalicious file and call them when running a specific task. Or you can add a new custom method to the source, which gets called when running a specific task. You can even extend existing methods and register them under a different name. (Needs more documentation.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNew task \ndrupalconsole:\ncommand\n. Runs the Drupal Console inside your container, on your host. If \ncommand\n is \ninstall\n drupal-console gets installed on that environment. The Drupal Console does similar things like drush, but there's currently no support to \"deploy\" via the drupal console.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nchanged\n\n\n\n\nscript-replacements are now prefixed by \nhost\n and \ndockerHost\n. You\u2019ll get a list of available replacements if fabalicious can\u2019t resolve all replacements successfully.\n\n\nAll declared yaml-variables are exposed to the script. You can access sub-dictionaries via the dot-syntax, e.g. \nhost.docker.name\n.\n\n\nThe task \nwaitForServices\n is now part of the docker-method. Invoke it via \ndocker:waitForServices\n\n\nThe task \nstartRemoteAccess\n is now part of the docker-method. Invoke it via \ndocker:startRemoteAccess\n\n\nThe task \ncopySSHKeyToDocker\n is renamed to \ncopySSHKeys\nand is now part of the docker-method. Invoke it via \ndocker:copySSHKeys\n\n\n\n\nthe common-section of the fabfile.yaml has changed, you can specify a common script per \ntype\n, e.g.:\n\n\ncommon:\n  dev:\n    - echo \"dev\"\n  stage:\n    - echo \"stage\"\n  prod:\n    - echo \"prod\"\n\n\nYou can even use custom types, but \nprod\n is reserved for production-installations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nunsupported\n\n\n\n\nuseForDevelopment\n is unsupported, use \ntype\n with value \ndev\n or \nstage\n\n\nhasDrush\n is unsupported, set your \nneeds\n accordingly.\n\n\nneedsComposer\n is unsupported, set your \nneeds\n accordingly.\n\n\nthe custom script-command \nrun_task\n is not supported anymore. Use \nexecute(\ntask-name\n)\n instead.\n\n\nthe task \nupdateDrupalCore\n is not ported over, not sure if it comes back.",
