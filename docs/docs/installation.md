# Installation of needed dependencies

fabalicious needs fabric 1.x, which dependes on python 2.x.

on Mac OS X:

    brew install python2 # not necessarily needed, you can try to use mac's native python
    pip install "fabric<2.0"
    pip install pyyaml

on Debian/Ubuntu

    apt-get install python-pip
    pip install "fabric<2.0"
    pip install pyyaml

If you want to use the slack-integration, install slacker, but it's optional.

    pip install slacker

Create a file called "fabfile.yaml" and add your hosts to this file. See this file for more information.

# General notes regarding MAMP usage

Make sure that the local instances of PHP and mysql are the actual MAMP binaries:

```$ sudo ln -s /Applications/MAMP/Library/bin/mysql /usr/local/bin/mysql```

Add the correct php binary to your .zshrc / .bashrc

```$ export DRUSH_PHP=/Applications/MAMP/bin/php/php7.0.12/bin/php```
